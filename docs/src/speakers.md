## Michael Stryker
Department of Physiology and Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience, University of California, San Francisco

Dr. Michael Stryker is a distinguished researcher and faculty member at UCSF, specializing in the development, plasticity, and functional organization of the central nervous system, particularly the visual cortex. His major discovery involves uncovering the critical period of plasticity in the visual system, highlighting the role of sensory experience in shaping brain circuits during early life. Currently, his research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of activity-dependent plasticity and its impact on neuronal responses in the adult brain. Using genetic interventions, neurophysiological techniques, and various recording methods, he investigates the cellular and circuit-level changes associated with lasting alterations in neural activity. Professor Stryker aims to unravel the complex relationship between physiological and anatomical changes in neuronal plasticity while exploring the differences between adult brain plasticity and critical periods in early development. His groundbreaking work advances our understanding of brain plasticity, with implications for neurodevelopmental disorders, learning processes, and sensory perception.

Dr. Tabrez Siddiqui is an accomplished researcher and associate professor at the University of Manitoba's Max Rady College of Medicine. He is primarily associated with the Kleysen Institute for Advanced Medicine and the Neuroscience Research Program at the Health Sciences Centre. Dr. Siddiqui's research focuses on synapse development, synaptic plasticity, and the molecular logic of neural circuits. He investigates the critical role of synapse organizing proteins in coordinating various aspects of synapse formation, maintenance, and synaptic plasticity. By studying the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse development and function, he aims to gain insights into neuropsychiatric disorders like autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Dr. Siddiqui employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining protein chemistry, molecular genetics, electrophysiology, and animal behavior, to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of synaptic function in both health and disease. His remarkable contributions to neuroscience research have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the NARSAD Young Investigator Award and the Brain Star Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
