# Overview

::: tip
Welcome to the official website of the 1st International Symposium for Adult Neural Plasticity and Brain Disorders. The symposium will be held in Shanghai, China on September 21 - 22, 2023.
:::



Brain diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, have become a major social problem affecting people's health. Currently, there lacks safe and effective clinical treatments for brain diseases, which requires more in-depth research on brain function, especially on the regulatory mechanism of neural plasticity, combining both basic and clinical studies.

 

The symposium will invite several Chinese and foreign scholars in the field of neural plasticity and brain diseases, focusing on reporting and discussing the regulatory mechanism of adult neural plasticity and its role in the pathogenesis of brain diseases, which could potentially provide insights and ideas for the treatment of brain diseases. The symposium will focus on these topics:

1. Regulatory mechanism of adult neural plasticity;
2. The role of neural plasticity in the pathogenesis of brain diseases; 
3. Potential directions for the application of modulating adult neural plasticity to the treatment of brain diseases.

Participants will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and stimulate novel and collaborative ideas. We look forward to your participation!
