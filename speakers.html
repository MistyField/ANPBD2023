His research focuses on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, specifically anxiety and depression, in response to psychological stress. Using molecular techniques and neural circuit approaches in transgenic mice, Dr. Anacker investigates the effects of stress and antidepressant treatments on different levels, from molecules to behavior. He is particularly interested in how early-life experiences can cause epigenetic changes in the brain, leading to long-lasting effects on gene expression and the development of brain circuits involved in mood and anxiety-like behavior. Notably, his work has revealed the presence of stress-responsive neurons in the ventral hippocampus that contribute to anxiety-like behavior. By studying the developmental mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress susceptibility and resilience, Dr. Anacker aims to develop new strategies for treating and preventing psychiatric disorders.</p></div></section> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> <div class="comments-wrapper"><!----></div></main></div> <!----> <div class="footer-wrapper footer" data-v-0b0d2b18><div class="sponsors" data-v-0b0d2b18><a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank" data-v-0b0d2b18><img src="fudan_logo_rec.svg" data-v-0b0d2b18></a></div> <!----> <span data-v-0b0d2b18><i class="iconfont icon-copyright" style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, .8);" data-v-0b0d2b18></i> <p data-v-0b0d2b18>
